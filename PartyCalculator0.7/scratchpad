add preferences for:
   "intensity" of the party
   		refactor BBQParty
   		refactor FondueParty
   		
other factors

take current weather into account

add food suggestions for each party type
	a) simple food suggestions at first
	b) complex food suggestions based on number of people

better coupling between party types???

change the party methods to have return types rather than void with side-effects??

show the party type on the main activity screen

debug fondue party - it is showing 0 , 0 , 0 regardless of the input
	it is instantiating the right classes
