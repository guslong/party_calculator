NEXT UP
add preferences for:
   "intensity" of the party
   initially get it working with a text field (as in lesson 15)
   then make it a preferences list (lesson 16) with only three options -  do they need to be in the model at all?
	
   		
   		
OTHER TO DO
take current weather into account

add food suggestions for each party type
	a) simple food suggestions at first
	b) complex food suggestions based on number of people

better coupling between party types???

change the party methods to have return types rather than void with side-effects??
  simplify the methods in fondue party also as beer and redwine methods simply return 0
  
show the party type on the main activity screen
