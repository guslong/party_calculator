MAIN TO DO
  
show the party type on the main activity screen
 1. text 
 2. cool icons
 
   		
OTHER TO DO
take current weather into account


add food suggestions for each party type
	a) simple food suggestions at first
	b) complex food suggestions based on number of people

cleanup the LINT warnings


better coupling between party types / less duplication of code
	refactor with Strategy Pattern? (exchange algortyhms at runtime)


change the party methods to have return types rather than void with side-effects??
  simplify the methods in fondue party also as beer and redwine methods simply return 0
  

maybe different result screens for the different parties
